So, the other recording that I'm uploading is really just like a stream of consciousness about some debug that I've been doing and I need it to be drafted into a coherent, concise message to send in an IM group chat to a couple of my team members about the current status and what I've found and to get their recommendation for the next steps or their opinion on the next steps, more than their recommendation. Emphasis on the concise.
